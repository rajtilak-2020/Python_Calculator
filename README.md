## 🚀 **How It Works**

The script operates as a **Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL)**:
1. 🖥️ Prompts you to enter a Python expression.
2. 🤖 Dynamically evaluates the input using Python's built-in `eval()`.
3. 📢 Displays the result of the evaluation.

**Example:**

```plaintext
>>> 5 + 7
12
>>> "Hello, " + "world!"
Hello, world!
>>> [x**2 for x in range(5)]
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
